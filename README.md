# Serialize

Serialize an element into an abstract, JSON-ifiable object and back again.

## Installation

```
$ npm install serialize-elem
```

## Use cases

Text editing. If you find another use for it, let me know.

## API

### var serialization = new Serialize( element )

Serializes the element into an object. Example:

```html
<p>Some <b>bold</b> and <em>italic</em> text</p>
```

gets converted to:

```js
{
    type: 'p'
    text: 'Some bold and italic text',
    length: 25,
    markups: [{
        type: Serialize.types.bold,
        start: 5,
        end: 9
    }, {
        type: Serialize.types.italic,
        start: 14,
        end: 20
    }]
}
```

Where `Serialize.types.*` is a number. Currently, only `<code>`, `<a>`, and various italic and bold types (elements, like `<b>`, `<strong>`, etc, but also other elements with, say, `style="font-weight: bold"`) are supported.

### serialization.addMarkups( markups )

Adds the array of markups to the serialization’s markups, ordering them first by type, then by start index, then by end index. This method is chainable.

### serialization.mergeAdjacent( )

Merges adjacent or overlapping markups of the same type. If you've recently added a markup, you should call this method to normalize things.

### serialization.toElement( )

Return a new element resembling the one that was serialized.

### Serialize.fromJSON( )

If you have previously `JSON.stringify`’d a serialization, you can get convert it to a “live” instance of Serialize by using this method.
